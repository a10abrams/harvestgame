## Readme
## The game
"Harvestgame" is the working title for now, which reflects the overall feeling it's trying to capture: the time between late September and late December when things in the northern hemisphere become cold and mysterious outside, while warm and cozy inside.

Use the arrow keys to move, jump, collect treats, and avoid enemies.

This game is written in JavaScript and not yet tested for mobile.

All of these bad boys are accessible!

## Possible updates / idea dump
1. MORE BACKGROUNDS are absolutely coming. 
2. More player sprites (I'm thinking animals/professional bakers/a person on a bicycle/etc.)
3. A save button for obvious reasons
4. Ability to fight (cast spells/punch to death)
